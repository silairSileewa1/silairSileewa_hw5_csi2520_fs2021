    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Silair Sileewa, I am 23 years old and I currently attend Oakland university. I am studying information technology and am currently in my junior year, however I have been taking classes for a bit longer. I was born in Iraq; however, I have lived in Michigan for the majority of my life. From a young age I was heavily interested in computers, originally my fascination started with playing video games on my family computer at home, and from there my fascination grew as I played around a bit with source codes others posted online of some of my favorite games. Most of the time what I would do is spend hours at a time watching YouTube guides on how to add things to these private servers, manipulate my experience in some fashion and generally understand what I was able to do. I didnâ€™t understand it at the time but this laid the foundation for understanding how programming works from a very basic level and as I made it to college and took my first couple classes I knew from then on this is what I wanted to do for a career. Currently I am not involved in any professional manner as a developer, nor have I been in the past. I would like to join the professional setting in concurrence with coursework I am currently taking as I believe that will propel me farther in my next steps in my career as well as expose me to how teams work on projects in the industry. My plans post-graduation is to hopefully be involved as a back-end developer in industry. To learn more about me check out my resume and fun facts page.
